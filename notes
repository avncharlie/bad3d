todo:

camera rotations are scuffed: try again

refactor (diff files etc)

merge

materials / colors on mesh


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
point:
    x, y, z 
    maybe rotate method?

renderInfo:
    color: color value

mesh:
    vertices (array of [points, renderInfo])
    edges (array of [[pointIndex, pointIndex], renderInfo])
    faces (array of [[pointIndex, ..., pointIndex], renderInfo])

    model is defined with center being 0,0

Camera:
    position
    distance
    angles
    scale
    method lookingAt:
        will set angles to look at wherever specified

3dObject:
    mesh 
    attributes (directly used by renderer):
        position
        rotation
        scale

    keyframe functions:
        <list of funcs created to pass through (0,0) and (1,1)>

    keyframe(attribute, endVal, time, keyframe function)
        will change attribute value as such over time with keyframe function

Object.applyAttribute / applyKeyframe(objects)

Scene:
    mesh (scene)
    objects = array of objects
    Camera
    canvas ctx

    Mesh can be imported to scene and Object returned

    methods:
        set objects:
            add objects to scene according to their attributes
            (start from empty world and add objects in 1 by 1)
            
        camera view: returns scene oriented to camera

        project: calculates projection and returns

        render: (renders to canvas)
            call set objects
            call camera view
            call project
            render projection to canvas
